# PA3: openFrameworks Snake
The objective for this first project is to complete the game called Snake with the help of openFrameworks!

# Project Overview
The project came with just the game itself. The snake just moved around and ate food, it crashed into walls and into itself.
We added a score, music, and some debug features.
We then added MenuStates, LoseStates and PauseStates.
We added entity classes in which these entities spawned randomnly and served as obstacles for the snake. 
We added powers ups to the game many of which grant speed, inmortality and extra points. 
Finally we made the food decay after a couple of seconds.
